            <p>March 23, 2024</p>
            <p>Hello, this is the first blog post for this app. I am seeking to build an app that can genuinely connect people without destroying their focus, lives, and mental health.</p>
            <p>If you are seeing this this is the first day code was put into this site, it is very new and raw</p>
            <p>Also, how did you find this? It is not publicized anywhere. That is kind of weird of you.</p>
            <p>My first order of business will be to allow users to login, and track daily gratitudes</p>
            <p>I can't wait to build on it from there, there will definitely be more to come. Thank you for visiting</p>
        </div>
