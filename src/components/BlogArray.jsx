I am excited for the first revision of this application to be complete. That will incompass allowing users to log in and write gratitudes for the day, they can see old gratitudes, update old ones, or delete them if they feel inclined. I have learned so much and I am still in phase one. I am very excited to continue working on this project. PS - yes the pages are UGLY but styilng will be coming soon!",

If you are seeing this, this is the first day code was put into this site, it is very new and raw. Also, how did you find this? It is not publicized anywhere. That is kind of weird of you. Thank you for visiting",
